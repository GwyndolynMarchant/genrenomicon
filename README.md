# Genrenomicon
*A markov-generated list of genre names for video games.*

Genrenomicon generates a list of genres using [quick-markov](https://github.com/Kansattica/quick-markov), fed from a seed list of genres which has been compiled from three major sources:

1. Wikipedia's [list of video game genres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_genres)
2. TV Tropes [video game genres](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameGenres)
3. [itch.io](https://itch.io) game descriptions

A full list of sources is available in [references](doc/references.md).
